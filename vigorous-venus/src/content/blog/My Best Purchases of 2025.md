Lately I’ve been reading far too many pieces titled “My Best Purchases of 2025.”
So many, in fact, that I briefly hallucinated that I should probably write one myself.

On the surface, these articles present themselves as annual summaries of things the author has bought—generous, even selfless acts of sharing. Dig a little deeper, though, and they reveal something else entirely: the quiet invasion of a consumerist worldview, and an arrogance so naked it’s almost impressive.

And I honestly have no idea who these writers are. Judging purely by their prose, I don’t find them particularly trustworthy. Why should I take their recommendations instead of, say, the editors of Wired? As platforms multiply, this kind of content simply shapeshifts—sometimes an essay, sometimes a post on Xiaohongshu (Rednote). By habit, I question other people’s lifestyles. More than that, I worry about these so-called authors quietly slipping in ads, converting my attention into revenue.

##### Pébéo Acrylic Markers
I don’t know why I need them, which probably means I don’t. I bought them in January and didn’t open them until December. I wrote a sentence on my electric scooter helmet: Crappy Helmet 4 Awesome People. I still don’t know why I made people plural.

##### KUM Automatic Long Point Sharpener
Every time I use a pencil, it feels insufficiently sharp. This solves that problem. Spending 60 yuan (about $9) on a sharpener, though, feels more like a tribute to my teenage self—the one who never hesitated when buying art supplies.

##### Kinto Cast 320ml Glass
It’s just a well-made glass. What more do you expect me to say?

##### Curaprox 12460
My favorite toothbrush at the moment. The bristles are so soft you could use them to brush a glans. I can’t find a better description.

##### Belkin BoostCharge Pro
When I pack it into my luggage for a long trip, I feel like a complete idiot.
But when I’m lying in a hotel bed, waking up miserably in the middle of the night, and my iPhone in StandBy mode tells me it’s three a.m., I realize that if I hadn’t brought it with me, then I’d be the real idiot.

##### HAY PC Portable Lamp No. 2
As I’ve said before, I’m an uncritical HAY junkie, so all my opinions are biased. To me, this isn’t really a lamp—I don’t need it to light anything in particular. It’s a symbol. That’s all.

##### teenage engineering EP-133 K.O. II
I’ll be honest: I don’t make music. I’ll even admit that I can’t really use this thing. But it looks excellent sitting on a bookshelf.

##### KACO POPUP
Included only because my students like it. Yes, shut up. In China, we’re allowed to give students small gifts.

##### Prince Hydrogen Chrome
Is it a good tennis racket? I can’t say for sure. My tennis instructor, Lee, once told me, “You see, no professional players use Prince.” Still, every time I bring it onto the court, it becomes a conversation starter. Which is unfortunate, because I’m socially anxious—or, to borrow David Letterman’s words for MrBeast, socially awkward.

##### Apple Magic Trackpad
An inescapable part of the complete Mac experience. Only when you actually use it do you realize how big, how good, how comfortable it is.

##### GRAZA Extra Virgin Olive Oil
Every time I see the illustration on the packaging, I smile. That’s what a successful product can do.

##### Ester & Erik LED Candles
Every single friend I have thinks they’re outrageously expensive. But an electronic candle made of real wax—one that will never burn down—is, philosophically speaking, a perfect object.

##### MOFT Apple Watch Band
Buy one and you’ll understand. Anything I say would be useless.

##### Kérastase Bain Densité Homme
Before I found this, I thought I’d never encounter a shampoo I genuinely liked. It smells like the kind of man I want to be. Just kidding. One should only want to be oneself.

##### Fujifilm X-E5
You might say: finally, you bought something that’s at least somewhat expensive.
That’s the only reason I’ve included it here.
The truth is, every camera I buy is the best camera for me at that moment. I don’t care about cameras. In photography, the more you care about the camera, the further you move away from the art.

##### A Century of Fiction in The New Yorker (1925–2025)
I need certain objects to make me look cultured and well read.

Other things worth mentioning: a baseball cap embroidered with “I want to play tennis.” A pack of Munken paper. A bottle of JEX lubricant. A handmade glass tube neon lamp.
If you are not confused by my lifestyle, this piece has failed.
